# When to Use Pulsar Worker Functions vs. Basic Redis & Celery

## Overview

This document explains the scenarios where you should use the Pulsar-based worker utilities (`run_io_task_with_best_practices_pulsar`, etc.) instead of traditional Celery + Redis-based workers in this codebase. It provides guidance for engineers on choosing the right tool for distributed task processing, with a focus on scalability, reliability, and production best practices.

## What the Celery/Redis Worker Utilities Provide

The `main.py` worker utilities in this repo are:
- **Production-grade wrappers for Celery tasks** that enforce best practices for I/O, DB, and CPU workloads.
- **Decorator Stack:** Each worker utility composes decorators for:
    - Tracing and logging
    - Error handling
    - Performance measurement
    - Circuit breaking (via tenacity)
    - Caching (Redis)
    - Rate limiting (per-user/service)
    - Credits deduction and authentication (JWT, API key, OAuth2, MFA, or none)
- **Async/Sync Support:** Handles both async and sync task functions, so you can use with modern FastAPI endpoints or legacy code.
- **Result Handling:** Uses Redis as the result backend, with polling and idempotency support for robust status tracking.
- **Consistent API:** Provides a `submit` function for each worker type, mirroring the Pulsar-based API for easy migration.
- **Observability:** All tasks are instrumented for logging, tracing, and Prometheus metrics.
- **Migration Ready:** Designed so you can incrementally migrate endpoints to Pulsar by swapping out a single utility import.

## Comparison Table

| Feature/Requirement                  | Pulsar Workers (Recommended)        | Celery + Redis Workers (main.py)    |
|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Horizontal Scalability**           | Excellent (cloud-native, partitioned topics) | Good, but limited by broker scaling |
| **Throughput**                       | High (millions of msgs/sec)         | Moderate (depends on Redis/broker)  |
| **Message Durability**               | Strong (persistent topics, DLQ)     | Moderate (depends on broker config) |
| **Retry & DLQ Support**              | Native, configurable                | Supported, but less flexible        |
| **Streaming & Event Processing**     | Yes (multi-subscriber, replayable)  | No (queue-based only)               |
| **Observability (Metrics/Tracing)**  | Built-in (Prometheus, OTel spans)   | Basic (needs extra setup)           |
| **Decorator Stack**                  | Yes (mirrors Celery utilities)      | Yes (full stack, see above)         |
| **Credits/Auth/Rate Limiting**       | Yes (identical API)                 | Yes (identical API)                 |
| **Legacy/Quick Setup**               | More setup, infra required          | Very fast, minimal infra            |
| **Best for**                         | High-scale, distributed, real-time  | Simple, legacy, or low-scale tasks  |

## When to Use Pulsar Worker Functions

Choose Pulsar-based workers if **any** of the following apply:

- You need to process a high volume of messages (thousands/sec or more) reliably.
- You require strict ordering, message replay, or event streaming semantics.
- You need Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) handling, advanced retry, or circuit breaker logic.
- Your system must scale horizontally across many worker nodes and data centers.
- You want built-in observability (Prometheus metrics, OpenTelemetry tracing) for all worker operations.
- You need fine-grained topic-based routing, filtering, or multi-subscriber consumption.
- You want to avoid Celeryâ€™s limitations with broker support, especially for advanced distributed patterns.
- You are building a new service or microservice that should be cloud-native and future-proof.

**Example Use Cases:**
- Real-time data pipelines, ETL, or analytics ingestion.
- High-throughput webhook/event processing.
- CPU/IO/DB worker pools for ML, scraping, or distributed computation.
- Mission-critical workflows needing robust retry, DLQ, and monitoring.

## When to Use Basic Redis & Celery Workers (main.py)

Choose Celery + Redis if **all** of the following are true:

- You have a legacy codebase already using Celery and migration is not feasible yet.
- Your workload is low-throughput, simple, and does not require advanced streaming or retry features.
- You want to prototype something quickly without additional infrastructure.
- You do not need advanced observability or distributed event processing.
- You want to leverage the existing decorator stack for credits, auth, rate limiting, and caching as implemented in `main.py`.

**Example Use Cases:**
- Lightweight background jobs in small/legacy apps.
- Ad-hoc tasks or one-off scripts.
- Systems where Redis is already the only broker and no scaling is needed.

## Hybrid and Migration Patterns

- The decorator and `submit` API in both `main.py` (Celery) and `pulsar.py` (Pulsar) are intentionally consistent. This allows you to migrate endpoints incrementally by swapping imports/utilities with minimal code changes.
- For new endpoints, prefer Pulsar. For legacy endpoints, use Celery/Redis until migration is practical.
- Both stacks enforce DRY, SOLID, and CI/CD best practices. Observability, credits, and security are first-class in both.
