# Input Validation Middleware Best Practices

- Apply strict input validation to all incoming requests (JSON, form, query params).
- Use Pydantic models or custom middleware to enforce data schemas.
- Reject and log malformed or malicious input before business logic executes.
- Sanitize input to prevent injection, XSS, and other attacks.
- Centralize input validation logic for maintainability.
- Add automated tests for common attack vectors and malformed payloads.
