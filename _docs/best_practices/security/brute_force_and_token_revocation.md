# Brute Force and Token Revocation Best Practices

- Lock out users/IPs after repeated failed login attempts (e.g., 5 tries, 5 min lockout).
- Use Redis/Valkey to track failed attempts and implement lockouts.
- Revoke tokens on suspicious activity or logout using a revocation list.
- Ensure revocation checks are performed on every request requiring authentication.
- Log all lockout and revocation events for audit and compliance.
- Monitor for brute-force attack patterns and alert on anomalies.
