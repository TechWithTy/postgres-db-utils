# Password & Credential Security Best Practices

- Enforce a minimum password length (12+ chars) and reject common passwords.
- Use strong password hashing and encryption (e.g., DataEncryptor).
- Rate limit password attempts (e.g., 10/min per user) to prevent brute-force attacks.
- Never log or expose plaintext passwords or secrets.
